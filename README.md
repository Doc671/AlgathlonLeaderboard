# Algathlon Leaderboard

## Instructions

To use with your Algathlon, change the properties inside the `athletes` array in data.json. Each athlete must have a `name`, `color` (RGB), `startPoints` value (the points at the beginning of the animation) and `earnedPoints` value (the points earned this event). You must also set `aliveAthletes` to the number of alive athletes in the competition *before* this event.

If you want to change the font, open leaderboard.pde in Processing and go to Tools > Create Font. Pick a font and a font size, note the file name and press OK. Go to data.json and change `mainFont` and/or `eliminatedTextFont` to the file name of the new font you picked.
